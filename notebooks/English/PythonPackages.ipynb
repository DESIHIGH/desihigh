    "In the [Introduction to Python](PythonTutorial.ipynb) notebook, we introduced the Python programming language. We will now introduce Python packages, which allow us to use Python code that other people wrote and published. We are going to look at some common Python packages that will show up in DESI High tutorials. Specifically, we will introduce the following packages:\n",
    " - NumPy: used to organize numbers and perform mathematical operations \n",
    " - Matplotlib: used to make graphs and visually represent data\n",
    " - Astropy: used for performing common operations in astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding NumPy, Matplotlib, and Astopy is not essential for completing DESI High notebooks. However, if you find yourself wanting to understand these packages better, this notebook will provide you with an overview. By the end of this notebook, you should be able to\n",
    " - Store and manipulate data in Python using NumPy arrays\n",
    " - Depict DESI data in Matplotlib graphs with informative labels\n",
    " - Model the behavior of our universe with Astropy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preferred Backgrounds\n",
    "While not necessary, having knowledge about the following topics will be helpful in completing this notebook on time:\n",
    " - How Jupyter cells work\n",
    " - How basic mathematical functions work\n",
    " - How we can use graphs to visually depict mathematical functions"

It turns out that we can't se the galaxies yet because the scatter function has drawn them too large, and they all overlap each other.

That sounds like a large distance, but the Bright Galaxy Survey is actually one of the closest DESI catalogs to us. Other DESI catalogs map out the locations of various types of galaxies that are located even farther away!"
