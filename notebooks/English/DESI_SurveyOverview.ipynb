    "The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey is making a giant, three-dimensional map of our universe by recording the positions of over 50 million galaxies. The data taken by DESI is teaching us about dark energy, a mysterious form of energy which is causing our universe to expand faster over time. The colossal undertaking of the DESI Survey is made possible by an international collaboration of scientists and institutions that work together to build equipment, take data, and perform scientific analyses. \n",

    "At different distances from us, different types of galaxies are ideal for observing with the DESI Survey. DESI galaxies are then broken up into four main categories, also referred to as **tracers**. The DESI galaxy category closest to us is the **Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS)**. BGS tracers are bright galaxies that DESI can observe when atmospheric conditions on Earth make it difficult to detect other, fainter galaxies. Even then, BGS galaxies include galaxies that are four hundred thousand times fainter than what what you can see in the night sky with your own bare eyes. BGS galaxies can be found thousands of millions of light years away from Earth (a light year is the distance that light travels in a year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we reach past about five thousand million light years from Earth, BGS galaxies are too dim to all be seen by the DESI Instrument. Instead, we observe a smaller selection of **luminous red galaxies (LRGs)**. LRGs are large, red elliptical galaxies that can often be found within massive galaxy clusters and that have long since stopped forming new stars. The old stellar populations in LRGs emit the red light that gives them their names.\n",

    "\n",
    "After reaching even further past about ten thousand million light years from Earth, a different type of galaxy becomes ideal for observing with the DESI Survey. **Emission line galaxies (ELGs)** are named as such because of their intense star formation, which is detectable from **atomic emission lines** (we’ll get to that later). Compared to the elliptical LRGs, ELGs are more often spiral galaxies that emit blue light. The bright, young stars in ELGs are what make them ideal for observing whith DESI.\n",

    "The final type of DESI tracer is also the most distantly observed, past about fifteen thousand million light years from Earth. These objects are **quasars (QSOs)**. QSOs occur when supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies attract matter from their surroundings. As matter falls into the vicinity of the back hole, it heats up and glows bright, allowing QSOs to be seen from vast distances away. Some of the infalling matter in a QSO can also get ejected from the galaxy, forming distinctive jets.\n",

We said before that DESI observes different tracers at different distances from Earth. We are now going to make a histogram of how many galaxies there are at different distances from Earth. This histogram will show use where each tracer type is most commonly observed. We will use galaxy data from the first public data release of DESI to make this graph.\n",
