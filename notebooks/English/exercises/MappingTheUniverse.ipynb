    "The DESI Survey is making a giant, three-dimensional map of the universe. This map will allow scientists to study some of the biggest mysteries in physics, chief among them being the nature of dark energy. Most maps that you see in your day-to-day life are two-dimensional, so it may be hard to picture what a three dimensional map looks like in your head. This notebook will detail how DESI is creating its map of the universe, what this map looks like, and how you can create your own version of such a map with DESI data.\n",

    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Read maps of the night sky with right ascension and declination coordinates\n",
    "- Understand the concept of a survey footprint and how DESI observes the night sky with overlapping survey tiles\n",
    "- Create a three-dimensional map of DESI galaxies along with a corresponding two-dimensional cross section\n",

    "Now that you've gotten a sense for mapping 2D projections of the night sky, let's focus on the regions of the night sky that DESI is interested. The angular region of the night sky within which a survey takes data is called the **survey footprint**. The Band of the Milky Way galaxy blocks our view of the distant galaxies behind it, so DESI instead focuses on the regions above and below the band of the Milky Way. These two regions are called the **DESI North Galactic Cap footprint** and the **DESI South Galactic Cap footprint**, and they are shown on the below map. The North Galactic cap is the larger of the two regions.\n",

There are also two numbers, **right ascension (R.A.)** and **declination (Dec.)**, that form a coordinate system which we can use to label the position of objects in the night sky. Right ascension and declination are both angles, and they work just like longitude and latitude on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what regions of the night sky we’re going to map, it’s time to start taking data! You learned in the Galaxy Spectra notebook how DESI captures light from distant galaxies with optical fibers and CCD images.

    "To start taking data, we point the Mayall telescope to a particular location in the night sky. We can then observe galaxies in a small, circular patch of the night sky that we call a tile. Once we’re done taking data, we move the telescope to point at a new new tile elsewhere in the sky, and we repeat this process again and again. The below image shows three close-together DESI tiles in the night sky that are labeled with blue circles.\n",

The plan starts with the date, followed by a list of times at which noon, dusk, and dawn occur, along with the times at which the moon rises and sets. This is followed by a table of DESI tiles to be observed. We will ignore most of the columns in the table, but there are a few that are of interest to us. The `local` column tells us what time to observe each tile at, and the `ra` and `dec` columns tell us the location of the tiles in the night sky. These columns are the right ascension and declination coordinates that we saw before."

    "You might notice in your cross-sectional map that some regions have many galaxies, and some regions have few galaxies. The way in which galaxies cluster together tells us about the evolutionary history of our universe and the underlying mathematical model of cosmology that describes it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the earliest era of our universe that we can observe, the matter within it was evenly distributed. Some regions were slightly denser than others, but these variations in density were small, on the order of one part-per-hundred-thousand. Over the billions of years that followed, gravity caused these slightly overdense regions to collapse and form structures. Under the influence of gravity, the once uniform universe evolved to develop galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and highly overdense regions on its largest scales. These overdensities are what form the dense regions visible in your cross-sectional map.\n",

    "Once again, we can see that galaxies cluster together to form web-like structures. What if we want to depict this map in three dimensions rather than using a cross section? As we saw before, three-dimensional maps can be challenging to depict on a two-dimensional screen. It helps however if we make our map intereactive, allowing us to move and rotate our field of view in real time.
