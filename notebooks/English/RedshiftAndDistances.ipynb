    "The *Doppler effect* is the change in frequency (or wavelength) of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source (or vice versa). You might have already encountered it, for example when an ambulance passes by with its siren on. As the ambulance approaches, the sound waves are compressed, leading to a higher pitch. As it moves away, the sound waves are stretched out, resulting in a lower pitch.\n",

The probe transmitted data back to NASA's *Cassini* orbiter, which then relayed the information to Earth. Due to the relative motion between Huygens and Cassini (and the Doppler effect), the frequency of the radio signal was too big, and could not be read by Cassini's systems - causing the signal on Earth to be unreadable. To solve this issue, the trajectory of Cassini was altered to reduce the velocity of the orbiter relative to Huygens, allowing the signal to be properly received. <small>(Read the more detailed explanation [here](https://www.thespacereview.com/article/306/1))</small>\n",

Conversely, if we have distance measurements from another method (see the [Distances Measurement notebook](DistanceMeasures.ipynb)), we can use them to infer the Hubble parameter $H_0$ by rearranging Hubble's Law:$$ H_0 = \\frac{zc}{D} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the concept of redshift and its significance in cosmology. We learned how to determine a redshift from observed and emitted spectra, and how to calculate distances using redshift in a cosmological context. Now that we know how to measure distances from the spectra of galaxies, we can use this information to map the large-scale structure of the universe, study the distribution of galaxies, and understand the expansion history of the cosmos.\n",
