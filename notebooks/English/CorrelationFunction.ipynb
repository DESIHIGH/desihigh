Imagine a universe in which no gravity exists. In that universe, no galaxies are being attracted to each other; they are spread out truly randomly. But in our universe, where gravity exists, we may see more galaxies closer to each other. Thus, this correlation function can tell us how important the force of gravity is at different scales. \n",
