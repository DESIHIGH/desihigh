If we zoom out of our galaxy, we find that the Milky Way is one of many galaxies in our universe, a fact that was first [discovered by astronomers in the early 1900s](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)>). \n",

    "To make a three-dimensional map of the universe like the one pictured above, we need to measure the distances to far way galaxies and figure out where they are located. There are several types of distance measurements, often referred to as **distance measures**, that we are interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some distance measures describe the **line-of-sight** distance between us here on Earth and far away galaxies. This is the line-of-sight distance along which light travels from far away galaxies to reach the Milky Way, and eventually, our eyes (or our telescopes). The below diagram shows the line-of-sight distance to two galaxies. If these two galaxies are in different parts of the night sky, then there will be some **angular separation** between their lines-of-sight. And, if we suppose that our two galaxies have the same line-of-sight distance to Earth, we can also describe the notion of a **transverse** distance between the galaxies.\n",

    "### 1.1 - What Does it Mean to Measure a Distance?\n",
    "In our everyday lives, we think of the distance between two points as being a fixed quantity. If there is a kilometer between points A and B, then that has always been the distance between points A and B, and that always will be the distance between points A and B. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, physics tells us that this isn't always the case. For example, in Albert Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, the distance between two galaxies is measured to be shorter when the observer is moving towards or away from the galaxies. The faster the observer moves, the shorter the measured distance. This phenomenon is called length contraction and is one example of how physics causes distances to behave in ways that are non-intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cosmology, there are a variety of types of distances that we are interested in measuring, and just like in Special Relativity, these distance measures are influenced in surprising ways by physics. "

    "Because our universe is expanding, the distance between any two points A and B will increase with time. The below animation shows an analogy for this expansion, where the universe is depicted as the surface of a sphere, and the sphere gets larger as time goes on. If you pick two of the galaxies in the animation and track them, you'll notice that the distance between the galaxies increases as the universe expands.\n",

If we measure the distance between those two galaxies today in the present (at time $t_f$), we will measure a larger distance: $d(t_f) > d(t)$. The ratio between the past and present distance is called the scale factor $a(t)$, and it describes how small the universe was in the past compared to today.\n",

How can we calculate this unknown **transverse comoving distance**?\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine a lightbulb glowing in a dark room. You may have noticed that, along with light, the bulb also emits some heat. As you move further away from the bulb, both the heat and the brightness you perceive decrease. In a sense, the amount of energy received from the bulb at a given point is **inversely proportional** to your distance from it.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$F=\\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}$$\n",

    "- \\(L\\) is the **luminosity** of the light source (the energy it emits per unit time),  \n",
    "- \\(d\\) is the **distance** from the light source, and  \n",
    "- \\(F\\) is the **flux** measured by an observer at distance \\( d \\) (i.e. the energy received per unit time per unit area).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this equation better, imagine the light from the bulb spreading uniformly in all directions, forming a large **sphere** of radius \\(d\\) (See the figure below). The total energy from the source is now distributed over the surface area of that sphere, which is ( $4\\pi d^2 $). So, the energy per unit area received at any point on that sphere is energy per unit time from the source divided by the area across which it is spread.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "d = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{4\\pi F}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the luminosity \\( L \\) of the bulb (say, from its power rating—60W, 100W, etc.), and we can **measure** the flux \\( F \\) at some point, we can easily **calculate how far away** we are from the bulb!\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea becomes a powerful tool in **astronomy** for measuring distances. Of course, the light sources in astronomy aren’t 100W bulbs—they’re **exploding stars** called **supernovae**, which can emit an enormous amount of energy in a very short time (luminosities on the order of $10^{47} W$ !!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, a type of supernova known as **Type Ia supernovae (SNIa)** has the remarkable property of having nearly **identical peak luminosities**. This allows us to calculate their distance from Earth using their measured flux. Because of this, SNIa are often called **\"standard candles\"** and are crucial tools for cosmologists trying to understand the structure and expansion of the universe.\n",
