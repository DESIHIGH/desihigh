When this accelerating expansion was first discovered in the years 1998 and 1999, we didn't know what was causing it. In fact, we still know very little about the physical cause of the accelerating expansion, which we attribute to a mysterious form of energy called **dark energy**. Studying and learning more about dark energy is one of the greatest undertakings in modern physics."

    "To make a 3D map of the universe, we need a way to calculate how far away distant galaxies are from us. The light that these galaxies emit takes time to travel to us. As the light waves travel, they get stretched out to longer wavelengths by the expanding universe. The farther a galaxy is away from us, the more time it will take for its light to reach us, and the longer its wavelength will be. To the human eye, longer wavelengths of light appear red (while shorter wave lengths are blue), so we call the stretching of the light \"redshift\". The farther away a galaxy is from us, the redder its light appears (or in other words, it has a larger redshift). This gives us a natural way to measure distances to galaxies."
