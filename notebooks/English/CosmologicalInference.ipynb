    "\n",
    "Let's try to apply this to an actual physical problem (be careful, maths ahead !)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 - Cosmological inference\n",
    "In cosmology, we try to estimate the values of the cosmological parameters that describe the universe model (see the [cosmological parameters notebook](cosmological_parameters.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "But in physics, any measurement must come with an uncertainty estimate (usually called \"error bars\"). In classical areas of physics, this uncertainty is reduced by taking a lot of measurements. By the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the measurements will be approximately Gaussian, and we can use the standard deviation of the sample to estimate the uncertainty, while its mean will be the best estimate of the value of the parameter. This is called the *frequentist approach*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cosmology, we measure our information on the Universe itself, which means we only have one measurement (or \"realization\") of our observable. So, how do we estimate the uncertainty of our measurements ? Also, how do we estimate the best value of the parameter ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - The Bayesian approach\n",
    "Instead of using the frequentist approach, we can estimate the distribution of the parameters, by randomly sampling the parameter space and measuring how close our model with those random parameters ($\\theta$) is to the actual measurement ($x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how close our model is to the actual measurement, we use the *likelihood function* $L(\\theta | x)$, which is defined as the probability of observing the data $x$ given the parameters $\\theta$. The likelihood function is a measure of how well our model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to define a prior distribution $P(\\theta)$, which is the probability of the parameters $\\theta$ before we observe the data. The prior distribution describes our beliefs (or *prior* knowledge) about the parameters before we see the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can use **Bayes' theorem** to calculate the posterior distribution $P(\\theta | x)$, which is the probability of the parameters $\\theta$ being the true ones given the data $x$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\theta | x) = \\frac{L(\\theta | x) P(\\theta)}{P(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(x)$ is the normalization factor, which is the probability of observing the data $x$ given all possible parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "(This formula might look familiar to you if you know about conditional probabilities !)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - How to chain\n",
    "This looks a lot like the Monte-Carlo method we used to estimate the value of $\\pi$, but more complicated !\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now using a multi-dimensional \"parameter space\" instead of a 2D space: the parameters are now a multi-dimensional vector $\\theta$ instead of a two-dimensional vector $(x, y)$.\n",
    "The $\\pi$ estimator (the ratio of points and the mask over the circle) is now replaced by the likelihood function $L(\\theta | x)$, and the area of the square is now replaced by the prior distribution $P(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now (with a lot of stuff under the hood here), we actually use what is called a *Markov Chain Monte-Carlo* (or MCMC) algorithm to explore the parameter space. The result of this algorithm is a *chain* of points in the parameter space, stored at each *step* of the exploration, which we can use to estimate the posterior distribution $P(\\theta | x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note :* Long story short, the MCMC algorithm uses methods to explores the parameter space in a way that the more points are close to the maximum of the likelihood function, the more likely they are to be selected. One of those methods is called the *Metropolis-Hastings* algorithm.\n",
